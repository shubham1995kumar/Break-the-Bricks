# Break-the-Bricks


**Overview**
This is a classic 2D Breakout game built on Unity, inspired by the classic arcade game "Breakout." The game features three challenging levels, each with different layouts and arrangements of bricks. Your objective is to control the paddle and bounce the ball to break all the bricks on the screen. The ball's speed increases with each level, making the game progressively more challenging.

**Key Features**
Classic Breakout gameplay with modern graphics and physics.
Three exciting levels with different brick configurations.
Five types of bricks with varying durability (1-3 hits to destroy).
Paddle power-ups to catch and launch the ball at different angles.
Score tracking and game over functionality.


**Gameplay**


Use the left and right arrow keys or A and D keys to control the paddle's movement.
Launch the ball by pressing the Spacebar.
Bounce the ball off the paddle to break the bricks.
Destroy all bricks to advance to the next level.
If the ball hits the bottom wall, you lose a life. The game ends when all lives are lost.

**Bricks and Power-ups**
The game features four types of bricks, each with a different color and durability level:

Green Brick (1 Hit): Requires one hit from the ball to destroy.
Yellow Brick (2 Hits): Requires two hits from the ball to destroy.
Red Brick (3 Hits): Requires three hits from the ball to destroy.
Blue Brick (Power-up): Releases a power-up when destroyed. The power-up falls towards the paddle and provides temporary benefits, such as increased paddle size or an extra ball.
